### üß† Use of Chatbots (ChatGPT, DeepSeek etc.)

Yes, we have used chatbot(s) (such as ChatGPT) for:
- Clarifying requirement specifications
- Helping structure the MVC implementation
- Explaining drag-and-drop logic and UNDO/REDO mechanisms
- Translating and polishing English content

Chatbot usage has been limited to support and understanding, **not to generate final code directly**.
